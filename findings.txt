findings:

-more FFT points means better accuracy filters, but requires more multiplications. might be important for small computers like RPI

-we could compute a matrix of filters and use the sparta plug-in but the computing power is much greater. 

- we don't need to use a helmholtz filter since the AF calib uses delta function as a target

- regular arrays might be better for 3D but harder to integrate to camera systems

- the smaller the array the more precision is needed for 3D printing = more expensive 

- ADA makes it easier, but slightly more expensive (time is money)

- calib allows us to diagnose issues and replace capsules

- we really only need one AF filter for 2D 8channel array since we can assume capsules are matched (MEMS), and the DFR is used for calibration. 

- harmonic purity depends on sensor distribution, good sampling of horizontal in 16 channel ADA array, bad sampling of vertical harmonics. 

- we need to re-add encoding coeffs to BF filters, otherwise we mess up the energy profile of the SH structure 

- using BF peaks vs DFR to EQ SHs yields different results

- on axis AF measurements are vastly different, probably because of diffuse field conditions, sensor placement, construction differences, etc. 

- the CM 43432 board had to be modified for L/R channel. 

- the outline of the 43432 board was the same as 52000, so we edited the board and ordered the TDM boards (for 16ch spherical arrays)
