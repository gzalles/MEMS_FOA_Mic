this is the audio comparison of a single ics-40720 with a single ambeo capsule
i did this to try to show how the sound of a single capsule compares...

I presume I got lazy and did the normalization in Audacity but the filtering in Ableton. Knowing myself...

I forget.

I personally prefer the sound of the MEMS. Then again I probably EQ'd it carefully. This does however show it is possible to get nice sounds out of them.
