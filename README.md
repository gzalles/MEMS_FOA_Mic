# MEMS Z-Array Mics

We moved the instructions to the wiki. There are several pages which will show how to build each of the different types of microphones we are woring on. So far we have built a few sizes FOA mics with analog MEMS. We are also exploring digital MEMS. The code should help you encode A to B format.

Find an updated list of associated assets here:

1. code: encoding, measuring, calibrating, filtering, plotting, etc.
2. cad: various 3d objects you can print either online or at your university.
3. pcb: the files you need to make the pcbs or also you can have them made elsewhere.

There should also be files to laser cut the foam rings and eventually more sophisticated code for HOA.

* we are currently developping a second order mems ambisonic mic w/ a behringer 8 channel interface and the calibration code running in Octave GNU thanks to Fernando Lopez-Lezcano from CCRMA. We are hoping to publish objective and ubjective analysis of these both and eventually have instructions on how to build a digital MEMS microphone in this repo, so stay tuned.
