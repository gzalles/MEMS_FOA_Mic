# CAD File

These are the CAD models we used for this design. At the moment these are not the best designs for low quality printers. We had to use a SLS printer (Form2) in order to get good results.

In the next design we are going to use the SpHear designs and modify them to make the MEMS fit. Hopefully that way these will be easier to print.

This file has 3 microphones since our experiment consisted of comparing these three designs.
