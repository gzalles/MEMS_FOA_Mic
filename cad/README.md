# CAD Files

These are the CAD models we used for this design. At the moment these are not the best designs for low quality printers. We had to use a SLS printer (Form2) in order to get good results.

In the next design we are going to use the SpHear designs and modify them to make the MEMS fit. Hopefully that way these will be easier to print.

This file has 3 microphones since our experiment consisted of comparing these three designs.

The larger mic looks a little funny because the base is small relative to the head. This is because we wanted to keep the diameter of the cylinder the same and reduce print time. I was not sure my mic clip would work with larger diameter.

By the way, I use an alligator style mic clip [like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Universal-Microphone-Holder-Amc417x6/dp/B00P6VIPCS?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_3) because the low quality prints can't handle the snap. Even if you use an SLS printer the neck is quite fragile so one of these bad boys would be good to have.
