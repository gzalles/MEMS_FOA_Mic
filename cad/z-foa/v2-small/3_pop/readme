The Form2 was able to print these files but there were a few problems:

* The two parts were too accurately draw in the CAD software, so even though the printer had really fine resolution (25 microns I believe) the prints did not 'fit' together with ease.

* The holes were the cables were supposed to fit from the top had a few issues, namely, 2 of them were inverted.

* If we want to fit a perfboard inside to support the battery then we have to make the base a bit wider.
