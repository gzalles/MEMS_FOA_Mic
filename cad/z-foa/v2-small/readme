# History

* 1_simple
  - Miniaturized from 12.5mm concept
  - Side port holes added

* 2_threaded
  - Threaded concept
  - Capsule backing added

* 3_pop
  - Popping concept
  - Neck tube added to hide cables

* 4_pop_v2
  - Bigger base to fit top easier
  - Bigger neck holes
  - Bigger holes to fit cables (1mm->1.25mm)

* 5_single_unit
  - Partially fixed inversion (the dimensions of the holes for the capsule and capacitor were guessed, I measured them and will update for next version [mems_board_diagram]). Need to also make the direction of the backing consistent.
  - Neck hole is larger but walls might be too thin. Using 34 AWG hookup this time instead of 28 awg.
  - Old body dimensions used, not made to fit battery inside or outfit with 10 pin connector.

  # To do
  * Print new breakout and get battery that fits inside
  * Trim body to fit head snuggly
  * Ref to 5.1

  The 10 pin connector is 15mm inside the body. The new breakout board is 24mm tall.
  I think I should try to make the BO board a bit smaller.
  The UR-power battery we have would be far too large...
  When buying a battery mind the current it provides, the MEMS draw 285uA each (times 4).
