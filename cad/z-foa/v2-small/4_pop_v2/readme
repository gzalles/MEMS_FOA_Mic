The print exhibit some problems:

We actually had not found out about the inversion problem until after, so by this version the problem had not been corrected.

The size of the holes that we used to fit the cables were augmented from 1mm to 1.25mm.

It was determined that 1mm was just enough for 28awg was just enough for 1mm hole but a bit too tight.

The size of the neck hole for the cables was also increased from 2mm to 3mm.

We have some 34awg wire on the way from Digikey.

The new print we are making is attempting to fix this inversion problem.
