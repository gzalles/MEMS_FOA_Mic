# Parts list:

* 1.75mm_mounted_pcb: representation of a PCB of 1.75mm thickness and 6.35mm diameter with a 40720 mems mic mounted and a 1uF capacitor (dimensions of capacitor: 1.6 x 0.80 x 0.9mm)

* 6.35diam_back: back support for MEMS PCB. Through holes for cabling are 0.75mm diameter, using 34 AWG wire. The backing is 1.75mm thick (since the MEMS is 1.2mm that leaves 0.55mm for the thinnest part).

* back_no_lip_no_moon_thicker: simple design that assumes the surface area of the MEMS capsule is enough to stabilize the PCB. Perhaps this is the simplest way to realistically scale. 

* back_tolerant_holes_off: more complex design that attempts to align components based on dimensions. (hole alignment was not measured carefully, might need to be redone)

* back_tolerant_holes_aligned: this one has aligned holes, let's see if it works.
