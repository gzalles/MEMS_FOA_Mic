# MATLAB

I used ScanIR to get the impulse responses of my system. We also recycled the rotating mount project from our first paper to get polar measurements.

I did not really understand Charlie's plotting scripts so I wrote my own.

This folder has those plotting scripts and some other functions that I am using written for this project.
