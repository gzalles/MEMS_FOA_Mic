future work

* compare array2SH sparta plug in to my methood using ANOVA study

* also implement and compare method with 64 filters each with 64 taps (sparta matrix conv)

* make 3d printed part for armm

* make robotic arm with multiple DoF 

* create datasets for ML soundfield synthesis 

* make open source pd IR recording system

* make JUCE plug-in 

* compare in experiment AF with individually calibrated filters (Q filters), versus no filters, versus global DFR. 

* compare omni camera audio only, v hybrid, versus only from z-array
