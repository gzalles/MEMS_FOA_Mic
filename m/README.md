# Objective-C

I used ScanIR to get the impulse responses of my system. We also recycled the rotating mount project from our first paper to get polar measurements.

I did not really understand Charlie's plotting scripts so I wrote my own.

This folder has those plotting scripts and some other functions that I am using written for this project.

ScanIR_edit folder is the version of ScanIR I edited for myself for this project! Ideally we should try to get the newest version of ScanIR and add these features: FOA_polar, etc. There should also be a button that pauses execution for 30 seconds so you can leave the room.

* I also added the stepper test in the scanIR folder. It would be good to have a button that tests if the stepper is working.

I am working on some other important functions, such as Nelson-Kirkeby. I also moved over to Octave GNU.
