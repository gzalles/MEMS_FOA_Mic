I need to make a 3D model of the stepper attachment. 

We need a BoM for the ARMM, and instructions on how to build and run it. 

I wonder if the MATLAB structs work the same in Octave. 
	http://psychtoolbox.org/download toolbox should work in Octave
	There is also an arduino package.

Pseudo:
* Center u-mic 1m away from source. 
* Input closest reflection path 
* 	Reflection path used for windowing 
* Inverse response (negate speaker effect)
* Single capsule equalization 
* A-format calibration 
* 	DFR method (horizontal only)
* B-format calibrationn 
*	Requires various angles, depending on order 
* Encode array 
*	Various methods to do this?
*		Based solely on geometry
*		Based on measurements
*		With additional constraints? DFR? (think MagLS approach)
