working list of functions:
//////////////////////////

* load_spkr_resp - load speaker response (plot optional)
* load_AF - load A-format 
* load_single -load single capsule meas

* gen_refl_win - generate reflection window
* gen_spkr_eq - generate speaker EQ filter
* gen_helm_filt - generate helmholtz filter
* gen_AF_filt - generate A-format filters ("matching")
* gen_enc_mat - generate encoding matrix for array
* gen_BF_filt - generate B-format filters
* gen_reg_vec - generate regularization vector for N/K

* eq_AF - EQ A-format signals (for helm and/or A-format "matching" filter)
* eq_BF - EQ B-format signals

* export_AF_filt - export A-format filters in wav format
* export_BF_filt - export B-format filters in wav format
* export_enc_mat - export encoding matrix as csv

* plot_mag_one - plot a single IR (not polar) [magnitude]
* plot_mag_many - overlaying multiple IRs in a single figure [magnitude]
* plot_polar_single - plot polar for single capsule
* plot_polar_BF - plot polar B-format
* plot_polar_VM - plot polar virtual microphone 

! should we have plots for phase response?

* calc_dfr - calculate diffuse field response(s)
* calc_nk - calculate nelson/kirkeby (N/K) inverse filter
* calc_snr - calculate snr of signal 
* calc_toa - calculate time of arrival differences for all capsules. 

* norm_AF - normalize the AF signals based on global maxima
* norm_BF - normalize the BF signals based on W (loudest harmonic)

* conv_sweep2ir - convert sweep to ir
* conv_AF2BF_FOA - use a simple sum and difference matrix to convert AF to BF (FOA only).

ideas:
/////

1. should we make a function that precedes the DFR filter generation that adjusts the gain of the AF signals based on fulcrum offset? [gain_match_AF] this might be easy for FOA and octo but how about 16 channnel mic? is this the same as the AF filter using DFR? maybe it is... 

calc_toa:

We can use these to time-align the IRs. In other words, we can phase match the capsules. Important when array is not perfectly centered in ARMM. I think the way to do this is average all the FREQUENCY RESPONSES (not mag), then get the average phase response, then get the group delay, then match (Q-1) capsules. 

Another method might be to use the time domain iFFT averaged frequency response, and use some threshold to determine where the sweep starts. 

* mostly applicable to measurements, not so useful in real life. the capsules and CAD models are quite precise. 

* calculate SNR (create function)
