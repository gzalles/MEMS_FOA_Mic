In order to confirm that REW does use the calib file you should compare the responses of both wav files!

Initial test of u-mik at home. I think I will try to do this again but do 4 or 8 repetitions. I have to put the dog in my room, he was moving around. 

The calib file incorporated the calibration file. I believe the export takes into account the calib file so long as it is correctly loaded, although I am not sure. I am still new to REW.
