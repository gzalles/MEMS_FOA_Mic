# 3.175mm Boards

These are the panelized files for the ICS-40720 board that Charlie Mydlarz designed. The radius of the board is 3.175mm. These are the current boards we are using for the analog mems FOA mic.

There is a lot of information of the datasheet online regarding these capsules. In order to acquire these board one must find a PCB manufacturer and pay them to send you the boards.

In our current design we opt for 1mm thickness.

We use 2-sided PCBs.

The only thing they ask is to upload the zipped file.

You might also want to get a stencil. With it you can more easily apply the paste to you PCBs.
